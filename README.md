# PatternRecognition
 Second test assignment for BlackRock for the Software Engineering position.

In this task, the input is a string entered in the console. The lines seem to consist of 2 parts, they are separated by the ";" symbol. The first part is our code. The second part
is the main line. Also, the main string is split into small substrings. Each substring is separated by some symbol (in our case it is "A"). Next, we must display how many times
our code appears in each substring, as well as how many times it appears in the string in general.
For instance:
Given the string "aa;iai32aaaAvf3vA4aaa";
In it, the code is "aa", the separator is "A";
Conclusion - 2 | 0 | 2 | 4
